   <h2>Dummy text</h2>
   <p>Lorem Ipsum is <b>simply dummy </b>text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <strong> industry's standard</strong> dummy text ever <mark>since the 1500<sub>s</sub></mark>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only <i> five centuries</i>, but also the leap into <em>electronic typesetting</em>, remaining essentially unchanged. It was <ins>popularised in the 1960<sup>s</sup></ins> with the release of Letraset sheets containing <small>Lorem Ipsum</small> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of<del> Lorem Ipsum</del></p>
