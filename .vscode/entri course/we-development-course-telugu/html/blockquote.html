   <h2> About telugu language</h2>
   <p>The following is the information about telugu language </p> 
   <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_language"> తెలుగు, Telugu pronunciation: ['telugu] is a Dravidian language native to the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where it is also the official language. Spoken by about 96 million people (2022),[6] Telugu is the most widely spoken member of the Dravidian language family, and one of the twenty-two scheduled languages of the Republic of India.[7] It is one of the few languages that has primary official status in more than one Indian state, alongside Hindi and Bengali.[8] Telugu is one of the six languages designated as a classical language by the Government of India. It is the 14th most spoken native language in the world.[9] Modern Standard Telugu is based on the dialect of erstwhile Krishna, Guntur, East and West Godavari districts of Coastal Andhra.[10][11][12]</blockquote>
